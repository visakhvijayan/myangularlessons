# AngularJS SANDBOX

> This is created for me to learn angular JS

## About Angular

1. Full featured JS framework created and maintained by Google
2. Why use Angular
   - Organized front-end structure (Components , modules, services)
   - Powerfull and full featured
   - All in one solution (Routing, HTTP, RxJS, etc)
   - Build powerful SPA(Single Page Applications) apps
   - MVC - Model , View , Control design pattern
   - Typescript
   - Fantastic CLI

## The Angular Way

1. Uses Typescript for static types (variables, funcitons, params)
2. Component based
3. Uses _Services_ to share data/functionality between components
4. Concepts of _modules_ (root module, forms module, http module, etc)
5. Uses RxJS _observables_ (basically data streams) for async operations
6. Steep learning curve relative to other frameworks

Prerequest : Need node js installed.(bz need npm package manager)

`npm install -g @angular/cli` to install Angular JS

`ng new <Project Name>` (It will create folder and generate all core angular files, also create routing modules , stylesheet etc.)

`cd <Project Name>` + `code .` to open the project in vs code

`ng serve --open` to run the dev server which provided by angular cli, `--open` for open in the browser
